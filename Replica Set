the main advantage of using daemon set over replica set is-
    -it will only allow 1 pod for every node which is usefull for checking logs for every node.
    - daemon set simplifies the deployment over replica set
    -we dont need to ensure pods are distributed to every node or not in daemon set
In any deployment whenever we need to achieve above mentioned properties we can use daeon set like used in log collector method .
